# The Burrow Clock

**The Burrow Clock** is a mobile-first, privacy-fundamental consensual family and friend presence sharing application within the Commonroom ecosystem.

## Product Scope & Boundaries
- **Domain Responsibilities**: Friend/family relationships for location sharing, geofencing, presence state computation, per-friend permission scoping, location-sharing sessions, group clock UI, and optional map views.
- **Non-Responsibilities**: Wizarding lore retrieval, trivia authoring, or AI-generated lore reasoning.

## Privacy Invariants
- Location sharing is default-off, strictly opt-in, permission-scoped per friend, and immediately revocable.
- Raw GPS coordinates are never broadcast by default; ambient presence and geofence states are prioritized.
- Fantasy/roleplay statuses (e.g., *"Mortal Peril"*) are purely aesthetic and strictly decoupled from real-world emergency/SOS features.

## Mobile Application Foundation

Commit 14 introduces the mobile shell in `mobile/`: TypeScript, React Native,
and stable Expo SDK 57 for iOS and Android. Its initial screen contains original
Commonroom text and styling, including a visible reminder that location sharing
is off by default. It requests no location permissions and collects no location
data. No franchise artwork, logos, book passages, or production content are included.

The app uses the existing pnpm workspace, the Node version in `.node-version`,
and the pnpm version in the root `package.json`. Run these commands from the
repository root:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts
pnpm --filter burrow-clock-mobile run dev
pnpm --filter burrow-clock-mobile run typecheck
pnpm --filter burrow-clock-mobile run lint
pnpm --filter burrow-clock-mobile run config:check
pnpm --filter burrow-clock-mobile run check:dependencies
pnpm --filter burrow-clock-mobile run bundle:check
```

Development starts Expo's Metro server. The `android` and `ios` scripts target
an available device or simulator; iOS simulators require macOS. Validation and
CI require no device, simulator, native SDK, Expo account, or signing credentials.
The bundle check exports iOS and Android JavaScript into the ignored `mobile/dist/`
directory; it does not build or sign a native application.
Expo's default Metro configuration supplies workspace support; no custom
navigation, bundler configuration, or service layers are needed for this shell.

### Deferred Functionality

- Identity and authentication
- Consent model and friend relationships
- GPS permission handling and location collection
- Geofencing and presence computation
- Realtime synchronization and WebSockets
- Backend/API
- Maps and notifications
- Background execution
- Sharing sessions, revocation, and expiry

The privacy invariants above govern future implementations. The initial screen
does not implement sharing or imply that any relationship or sharing session exists.
